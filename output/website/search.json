    "text": "Interpretations\nWater year 2024 was above average in precipitation for both the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their watersheds. Chlorophyll a and pheophytin a values were low overall, with many samples being below the detection limit. Higher outflows that can occur during wet or above normal water years often reduce the residence time of the water, leading to less opportunities for large algal blooms. The phytoplankton community in all regions was dominated by small, but numerically abundant, cyanobacteria. Phytoplankton fell into 12 distinct categories, similar to previous years, with nearly all groups being found in all regions. However, the top ten taxa fell into just 5 categories, showing that while the overall community is diverse, phytoplankton tend to be numerically dominated by a small number of algal groups."

For the months that coincide with the passage of fall-run Chinook salmon (October, November, and September), values fell below the 6 mg/L limit in September. For all other months, values fell below the 5 mg/L limit in July.

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater Year 2024 started off dry, but a series of storms in February and March brought the water year to be classified as Above Normal. Patterns in water quality generally followed expected seasonal and regional trends. Specific conductivity varied greatly across the stations and throughout the water year, depending on precipitation and Delta outflow. North and South Delta stations remained fresh throughout the year, whereas most Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay stations had low specific conductivity values from February through early June. The specific conductivity at D6A, the westernmost station, started increasing in mid-March, far earlier than the rest of the stations. Decreases in dissolved oxygen and increases in turbidity were observed between February and March, likely associated with increased discharge from storm events. Shallow bays and Suisun Marsh exhibited more persistently high and variable turbidity compared with other stations. Elevated fluorescence, dissolved oxygen, and pH were measured in the South Delta during late June and July associated with a bloom event."
