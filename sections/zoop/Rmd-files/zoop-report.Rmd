## Current Report {#zoop-report}

### Introduction

This report presents zooplankton annual and seasonal abundance indices and distribution trends from 1974 through 2020 for the most common copepods, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids of the upper estuary.

***
### Trends

Since the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1974, a significant decrease in the overall abundance of zooplankton has been detected in the estuary (Figure 70). Only the abundance of cyclopoid copepods increased in the region during this period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance in the estuary can be attributed to a series of invasions into the estuary, most notably that of the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). The spread of P. amurensis throughout SFE has had significant impacts on planktonic abundance in the upper estuary due to its high filtration feeding rates on phytoplankton and copepod nauplii. Not only has abundance decreased for most of the zooplankton groups, but dramatic shifts in the composition of these communities have been detected during the study period. These changes have been driven by the introduction and spread of non-native zooplankton species throughout the estuary, compounded with changes to the abiotic and biotic environments.

#### Calanoid copepods

While overall calanoid copepod abundance has declined slightly over the study period, community composition has shifted dramatically (Figure 70A). When the study began in the early 1970s the copepods Eurytemora affinis and Acartia spp. dominated the calanoid community. The non-native E. affinis was once the primary prey item of the endangered Delta Smelt, but its abundance has declined to a fraction of what it once was, forcing fish to prey switch to more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014). One of the first recorded introduced calanoid copepods was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and became the most dominant calanoid species in the estuary for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). Then in 1987, after the invasion of P. amurensis, the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was introduced and first detected in the region, competing with the abundant E. affinis (Orsi and Walter 1991). P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. Another introduction occurred in 1993, when the predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis quickly became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in Suisun and the West Delta (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion was hypothesized to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi and calanoid copeopds towards the freshwater zone of the estuary (Figure 71A), as predation on P. forbesi nauplii by A. sinensis has been recorded (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017).

In general, calanoid copepod abundance is highest in the estuary during the summer and fall months, with lowest abundances during the winter (Figure 72A). While calanoid copepod abundance peaked in the summer of 2017 at a nearly 20 year high, 2018 through 2020 abundance returned to levels comparable to the previous two decades. In 2020 the distribution of calanoids throughout the estuary was similar to the last two years, with P. forbesi the most abundant in summer and fall in most of the upper estuary (Figure 72A). The predatory Acartiella sinensis was seen in highest densities in the summer and fall mostly in the Suisun Marsh and Suisun Bay regions, similar to 2018 and 2019. In fall 2020, A. sinensis was the most abundant calanoid in Suisun, where it co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey items Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 72B), while P. forbesi was most abundant to the east of Suisun Bay. Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid copepod commonly found in 2020, but it was restricted to Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay in the lower reaches of the estuary. Eurytemora affinis was most dominant calanoid upriver of Suisun Bay estuary in the spring of 2020, similar to seasonal distribution patterns of the last two decades.

#### Cyclopoid copepods

While overall zooplankton abundance has declined over the study period, the abundance of cyclopoid copepods exploded (Figure 70B). The native Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were at low abundances when the study began, but with the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s, and the later identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993, cyclopoid indices have increased dramatically(Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999) Abundance indices for the two species of Limnoithona were reported together from 1980 through 2006 as Limnoithona spp., then separately since 2007 when they were identified and enumerated as L. sinensis and L. tetraspina. In 2020, L. tetraspina abundance was the highest observed for all copepods (Figure 70B).

Much smaller than calanoid copepods collected in the CB net, the Limnoithona cyclopoids are best retained in pump samples, which use aa smaller mesh. Since the early 1990s, Limnoithona spp. abundance has been higher than calanoid copepod abundance, and the small L. tetraspina has become the most common zooplankton in the upper estuary. This increase in L. tetraspina abundance is likely due to a decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE and subsequent decreased predation (Kimmerer 2006), as well as the cyclopoid’s small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior, making it very difficult for visual feeders to capture (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006; Greene et al. 2011). These characteristics may increase its ability to escape predation in a region where visual predation is most dominant among fish (Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspin is also linked to the reduction of the range of P. forbesi out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as high L. tetraspina densities may have fed and sustained larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also fed on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017).

Seasonally, Limnoithona tetraspina peaks in summer and fall (Figure 71B), with lower abundance in winter and spring. As in prior years, this cyclopoid was most abundant in the low-salinity zone of the estuary in Suisun Bay and the West Delta (Figure 72B). Oithona davisae, a native cyclopoid, was the most abundant cyclopoid in the higher-salinity San Pablo Bay in summer and fall (Figure 72B).

#### Cladocera

The cladoceran community of the upper estuary is composed of Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma species, whose populations have also substantially declined since the onset of the study (Figure 70C). These cladocera tend to be herbivorous, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, and were likely hard hit by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Kratina and Winder 2015). Cladocerans make up a significant portion in the diets of Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, and young-of-the-year Striped Bass throughout the upper estuary (Heubach et al. 1963; Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018). The invasion and increase of available copepod prey such as P. forbesi and the decline in cladocera has created a shift in the nutritional content of the plankton community available for fish, with yet to be determined consequences (Kratina and Winder 2015).

While Cladocera abundance has declined overall since the study began, recent years abundance has been increased and in 2020 cladocera abundance was the highest observed since 1992 (Figure 71C). In the high outflow year of 2017 some cladocera, namely Bosmina, were found downstream in Suisun and the West Delta, while in 2020 the highest densities of cladocera were found in the East Delta, with trace concentrations found in other regions of the estuary (Figure 72C).

#### Rotifer

While they are the most abundant zooplankton in the estuary, long-term sampling of rotifers using the pump system shows a dramatic decrease in their annual abundance in the estuary since the beginning of this study (Figure 70D). Several species of rotifers make up the community: most abundant being the Polyarthra, Synchaeta, and Keratella genera. Interestingly, the decline of rotifer abundance beginning in the late 1970s preceded the invasion of P. amurensis in the estuary (Cloern and Jassby 2012).

The distribution and abundance of rotifers were similar in 2020 to previous years, with abundances similar to those found since the invasion of P. amurensis. Overall rotifer abundance peaked in the summer and spring (Figure 71D). Keratella and Polyarthra tend to be most abundant in the freshwater and low-salinity zone of the estuary, while Synchaeta species occur most in the higher-salinity areas of San Pablo Bay and Suisun (Figures 3D and 4D)(Winder and Jassby 2011). A spatial and temporal split was discernable between Synchaeta and other rotifers, with Synchaeta having highest densities in the low-salinity zone Bay during the spring, and other rotifers being most abundant in the East Delta in summer.

#### Mysida

Not only have mysid abundances declined significantly since the 1970s, but the community has also shifted from being composed almost entirely by the native Neomysis mercedis, to being dominated by the non-native Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 70E). The first significant decline in N. mercedis occurred during the 1976-1977 drought, likely caused by food limitation from an absence of diatoms due to very low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). The populations of N. mercedis were able to rebound after the years of drought and stayed at high densities in the Suisun Bay region of the upper estuary until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers crashed.

In 1993 the introduced H. longirostris was first detected by this study, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis, and it quickly became the most common mysid in the system. However, overall mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 70E). Mysids have always peaked in the spring and summer months, fluctuating with the higher productivity in the estuary during those seasons (Figure 71E). Historically mysids have been of critical importance in the diets of many fish species in the SFE including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). However, the decline of mysids in the upper estuary has resulted in a significant decrease in their presence in the diets of fishes of the region (Feyrer et al. 2003). This general decline in abundance continued in 2019, even though 2016 and 2017 had a modest peak in mysid abundances (Figure 70E), and the distribution and timing of peaks stayed similar over the last two decades (Hennessy 2018). Hyperacanthomysis longirostris was again the most common mysid in the estuary during all seasons, while the once common and native Neomysis mercedis continued to be almost imperceptible in the region. This has been the overall trend in the estuary’s mysid communities since 1994. As in prior years, mysids in 2019 were most abundant during the summer and fall (Figure 71E), and highest concentrations occurred in the low-salinity zone of Suisun Bay and Marsh (Figure 72E).

### Conclusion

In 2019 the Zooplankton Study recorded the abundances of calanoids, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids at lower densities comparable to other recent years and consistent with the downward historic trends in the estuary. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepod abundance peaked in fall, whereas cladocera, rotifers, and mysids peaked in summer. The small, abundant Limnoithona tetraspina was again the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary. This multi-decade zooplankton study has enabled researchers and managers to track the shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition across the estuary for nearly 5 decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the community’s response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing food resources for fish and conservation strategies in the San Francisco Estuary.
