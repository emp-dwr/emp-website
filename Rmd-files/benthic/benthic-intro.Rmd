# Benthic {#benthic}

### Background
Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods.  Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species.

Benthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms.

A large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food.  Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary.

Changes in benthic organisms’ populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition.

### Monitoring {.unlisted .unnumbered}
The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) has been sampling benthic invertebrates in the San Francisco Estuary since 1975.  The benthic monitoring program is one element of DWR’s and USBR’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton and phytoplankton. The overall objective of the benthic monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in benthic fauna presence, abundance and distribution associated physical factors in the estuary. Data collected from the benthic monitoring program is also used to detect newly introduced species in the estuary. 

Geographic coverage of the sampling sites ranges from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne and San Joaquin rivers (see Figure 1). The study area currently comprises ten sites that are sampled monthly. These sites represent a wide variety of habitats that vary in size and physical make-up as well as water quality and sediment composition. The aquatic habitats sampled range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. The mixing of river water with tidal water creates a wide range of water quality conditions. For example, salinity ranges from freshwater to around 29 ppt in the most western sites. 

A 0.052 m2 Ponar dredge is used to sample the benthic sediment, and all organisms larger than 0.5 mm are identified and enumerated by taxonomy contractors.  To date, 414 species in ten phyla (Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Chordata, Phoronida and Echinodermata) have been collected from the study area. Sediment composition data are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program to document general trends in sediment composition for all sites where benthic samples are collected.
