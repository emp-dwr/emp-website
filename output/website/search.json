    "text": "Methods\nZooplankton have been sampled in the upper SFE since 1972, once or twice per month from March to November through 1994, and monthly from 1995 to the present. Sampling was modified due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no surveys in April and May 2020, a reduced survey (five stations) in December 2020, and no surveys in January and February 2021. Samples were collected at stations from San Pablo Bay through the Delta (Figure 1), including up to four non-fixed stations representing the low salinity zone (LSZ), defined as bottom specific conductance of 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). As of June 2024, sampling was suspended at stations 2 and 4 (Carquinez Strait), 325 (San Pablo Bay), and low-salinity zone stations in the San Joaquin River, but this sampling may be reinstated in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nZooplankton were sampled using three gear types that target different size classes: 1) pump samples (collected with a 1/10 hp, 12V utility pump) filtered through a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, copepod nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); 2) Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with 160-micron mesh to sample meso-zooplankton (cladocerans and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); 3) mysid net with 505-micron mesh targeting mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. The mysid and CB nets were mounted on the same tow sled and samples were collected in 10-minute stepped oblique tows over the depth range of each station.\nCatch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated using the volume of water filtered during a net tow. Volume filtered during mysid and CB tows was determined using a General Oceanics flowmeter mounted in the mouth of each net and calculated as:\n\\[V=(endmeter−startmeter)k∗a\\]\nwhere V is the volume of water sampled (mL), k is the flow meter constant, and a is the area of the mouth of the net (m2).\nThe pump samples 19.8 gallons over the upper 30’ of the water column, filtered through a 43-micron mesh net. All zooplankton samples are preserved immediately after collection in 10% formalin with rose bengal dye. Target organisms in each sample are identified and counted in the laboratory using dissecting microscopes. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata here.\nAbundance indices are calculated for each organism from its target gear type (noted above). Abundance is reported as mean CPUE, calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled:\n\\[CPUE=s∗V^{−1}\\]\nwhere s is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample.\nCalanoid and cyclopoid copepod abundance indices reported here comprise adults only, as juveniles cannot always be identified to species. Annual and monthly abundance indices were calculated using 16 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 1) and two to four non-fixed LSZ stations (described above). Note that the number of LSZ stations per survey varied as only one sample was collected if the LSZ location was the same as a fixed station.\nTo analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Monthly abundances span the period from October 2023 through December 2024 to encompass both water year and calendar year and are also shown by region, as detailed in each section below. Estuary regions are designated as San Pablo Bay (stations D41, D41A, 325), Suisun and Grizzly Bay (stations 2, 4, D6, 28, 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32, S42), Confluence (stations 54, 60, 64, 74), Central Delta (stations D16, 86, D28, M10), North Delta (68), and South Delta (92) (Figure 1). Non-fixed LSZ stations were assigned to a geographic region based on their location, which was most often in the Confluence in 2024 (18 of 21), or Suisun and Grizzly Bay (April, May, June). Sampling of LSZ stations in the San Joaquin River was suspended as of June 2024, but an LSZ station was only found in this region in January. Annual indices include data from the 16 core stations and the two LSZ stations not in the San Joaquin River. Monthly CPUE by region for 2024 includes data from all LSZ stations (fixed and non-fixed).\nBiomass of copepods, cladocerans, and rotifers was determined following standard methods (Bashevkin et al. 2022 and references therein) using literature values of carbon per individual (Dumont et al. 1975, Salonen, K., Latja, R. 1988, Uye et al. 1983, Culver et al. 1985, Sabatini and Kiørboe 1994, Uye and Sano 1995, Walz 1995, Kimoto et al. 1986, Logerwell and Ohman 1999, Hooff & Bollens 2004). For mysids, dry weight was calculated based on length and converted to carbon using a standard conversion of 40% (Wiebe et al. 1975, Kiørboe 2013). Biomass is reported as biomass per unit effort (BPUE, calculated using volume filtered as for CPUE) by region for the most abundant species in the estuary."

    "section": "Trends",
    "text": "Trends\nThe overall abundance of zooplankton in the estuary has decreased significantly over the course of the Zooplankton Study (Figure 3). Cyclopoid copepods as a whole were the only group that increased in abundance over the study period, but this was driven by the introduction and proliferation of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in the mid-1990s. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance can be attributed to invasive species colonizing the estuary, most notably the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer et al. 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). Abundances of both phytoplankton and zooplankton in the upper estuary have been impacted by the proliferation of P. amurensis, as it is a highly efficient filter feeder and consumes phytoplankton and small zooplankton, including copepod nauplii. In addition to decreased abundance of most zooplankton groups, community compositions have changed dramatically during the study period (Figure 3), driven by a combination of the introduction and spread of non-native species and changes in the abiotic and biotic environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalanoid copepods\nAside from a 25-year high in calanoid copepod abundance in 2017, total abundance was similar from 1995 to 2024 (Figure 3). Total abundance of calanoid copepods in 2024 declined slightly compared to 2023 but remained within the range of the past six years (2018-2023) (Figure 3). Proportions of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi and Acartiella sinensis also remained similar during this period (Figure 3). Adult calanoid copepod abundance declined only slightly over the study period, but their community composition changed dramatically (Figure 3). When the study began in the early 1970s, the calanoid copepod community was dominated by Acartia spp. and an introduced species in the genus Eurytemora (initially identified as E. affinis (Esterly 1924), now considered E. carolleeae (Alekseev and Soussi 2011), referenced in this report as Eurytemora spp.). Even though Eurytemora spp. is not native, it was once the primary prey of the endangered Delta Smelt. However, as its abundance declined, fish increasingly preyed on more recently introduced calanoids like P. forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014).\nOne of the first recorded calanoid copepod introductions was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and remained the most dominant calanoid species for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). The calanoid P. forbesi was first detected by the present study in October 1987 (Orsi and Walter 1991), shortly after the Potamocorbula amurensis invasion in the mid-1980s (Carlton et al. 1990, Kimmerer et al. 1994). Combined effects of these introductions may have influenced subsequent abundance declines of E. affinis and S. doerrii. P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. The predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis was introduced in 1993 and soon became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in the Suisun Marsh and Confluence regions (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion appears to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi towards freshwater areas of the estuary, potentially in relation to predation by A. sinensis on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017).\nCalanoid abundances, including Eurytemora spp., were very low from January through March in upstream regions (South, Central, and North Delta, and Confluence) (Figure 4), in contrast with seasonal distribution patterns from drought years (2020 through 2022) that showed Eurytemora spp. as the most common calanoid in these regions in spring (see link in Reference section to previous zooplankton annual reports).\nSimilar to recent years, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was dominant in the South, Central, and North Delta, and Confluence but abundances in 2024 remained low until May or June (Figure 4) whereas in prior years abundances increased starting in March (see link in Reference section to previous zooplankton annual reports). P. forbesi inhabits low salinity waters so this species is typically rare in downstream regions but was fairly abundant in May and June in Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bay (Figure 4). Unlike 2023, this species was not found in San Pablo Bay (Shaw and Hieb 2024). P. forbesi was abundant in the North Delta in December 2023 and July 2024 but calanoids were low in all other months in this region. In the Confluence region, P. forbesi abundance increased substantially between April and May and was high in June but decreased in subsequent months (Figure 4).\nThe predatory Acartiella sinensis was the dominant species in the Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions in July and August but from September through November numbers of A. sinensis and P. forbesi were similar in these regions (Figure 4). Abundance of A. sinensis in the Confluence region was similar July through November, but high in Suisun Marsh only in August. In Suisun and Grizzly Bay P. forbesi was fairly abundant in May and June but A. sinensis dominated the region from July through October. In these three regions, A. sinensis co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey items, Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 5). P. forbesi abundance was high in Suisun Marsh from March through July in 2024, in contrast with low abundances in this region during the drought years from 2020 through 2022 (see link in Reference section to previous zooplankton annual reports).\nAcartia spp. were the only native calanoids commonly found in 2024, and they were present only in the lower estuary. These copepods prefer brackish water and were the most abundant copepods in San Pablo Bay from March through December, though monthly abundances varied (Figure 4). In Suisun and Grizzly Bay, Acartia spp. were present during most months but abundant only in December 2024. Eurytemora spp. were abundant in this region from February through June in 2023, while in 2024 they were only moderately abundant in April and May. In 2024 Tortanus spp. were present in this region throughout the year (Figure 4) while in 2023 they were essentially absent from this region until June (Shaw and Hieb 2024). In San Pablo Bay, Tortanus spp. abundances were low, aside from moderate abundance in February (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyclopoid copepods\nIn contrast with the general decline of major zooplankton groups during the study period, adult cyclopoid copepods increased dramatically, particularly from 2012 to 2022 (Figure 3). In 2023 cyclopoid copepod abundance declined to about half the average for the previous decade (Figure 3), likely because these small organisms were transported downstream by high freshwater outflow, but cyclopoid abundance in 2024 was similar to 2022 (Figure 3).\nAbundances of Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were very low when the study began (Figure 3), and the increase in cyclopoid abundance resulted from the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s and subsequent identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993 (Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). These two species were reported together as Limnoithona spp. from 1980 through 2006. Limnoithona were identified to species starting in 2007, leading to the discovery that L. tetraspina is by far the dominant species. For the sake of consistency, abundances were combined and reported here as Limnoithona spp. In 2024, Limnoithona spp. was by far the most abundant copepod group collected by this study (Figure 3).\nThe increase in L. tetraspina abundance may be related to decreased predation due to the decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE (Kimmerer 2006). In addition, the small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior of L. tetraspina may decrease its vulnerability to predation in a region where most fish are visual predators (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006, Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspina is linked to P. forbesi distribution shifting upstream of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as higher densities of L. tetraspina may sustain larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also preys on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017).\nLimnoithona spp. were the most abundant cyclopoids in 2024, but their abundances were generally low from January through May in all regions of the estuary and remained low in the South, Central, and North Delta in comparison with other regions (Figure 5). Limnoithona spp. abundances increased in the Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions starting in June or July and remained high through November (Figure 5). In previous years Limnoithona spp. have been virtually absent from San Pablo Bay, but were moderately abundant here in March and May 2024, then declined with increasing salinities, concurrent with increased abundance of the introduced Oithona davisae, typically the most abundant cyclopoid in this region (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCladocerans\nCladocerans in the upper estuary primarily comprised species in the genera Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Daphnia, and Diaphanosoma. Their populations have declined substantially during the study period (Figure 3). Although there has been somewhat of an increasing trend since the late 1990s, abundances in 2023 and 2024 were among the lowest since 2013 (Figure 3). Cladocerans are largely herbivorous and feed primarily on phytoplankton, so they likely were impacted by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Greene et al. 2011, Kratina and Winder 2015). Throughout the upper estuary, cladocerans comprise a significant portion of Delta Smelt and juvenile Chinook Salmon diets (Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018) and were historically an important food source for young-of-the-year Striped Bass (Heubach et al. 1963). Increased abundances of invasive copepods such as P. forbesi and the declines in native cladocerans may alter the nutritional content of the planktonic prey available to fish (Kratina and Winder 2015).\nIn the early years of the study, the cladoceran community was dominated by Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia spp. (Figure 3). Over the last decade, the cladoceran community shifted to higher proportions of Ceriodaphnia spp. and Diaphanosoma spp., although B. longirostris and Daphnia spp. were still present (Figure 3). Cladoceran abundance in 2024 was only slightly higher than 2023, with Diaphanosoma spp. the most abundant taxon, followed by similar abundances of B. longirostris and Ceriodaphnia (Figure 3).\nCladoceran abundances overall were lower in most regions in 2024 compared to 2023 (Shaw and Hieb 2024) in all regions except the South and Central Delta (Figure 6). Note the difference in scale between these two regions and the rest of the study area (e.g. South Delta CPUE in October 2024 is higher than maximum CPUE in all regions except Central Delta). In the South and Central Delta, low abundances of cladocerans in the early months of the year comprised B. longirostris, Ceriodaphnia spp., Daphnia spp. and the “other” category. Abundances were high from June through September with Diaphanosoma spp. the most abundant taxon in these regions, along with Ceriodaphnia spp. in the Central Delta in July and August, and B. longirostris in July in both regions (Figure 6).\nIn the North Delta, abundances were highest in February and March, low July through November, and high in December (2024), with similar species composition (B. longirostris, Ceriodaphnia spp., Daphnia spp., and “other”) during periods of high abundance. In the Confluence region abundances increased starting in January and remained elevated through July, although the species composition changed from B. longirostris, Ceriodaphnia, Daphnia, and “other” from January through April, to higher numbers of Ceriodaphnia in May and a dramatic increase in Diaphanosoma in June (Figure 6). Abundances were much lower from July to September, but Diaphanosoma remained the dominant taxon (Figure 6). In Suisun and Grizzly Bay and Suisun Marsh, cladocerans, largely B. longirostris and “other”, were present in winter and spring months but all taxa were essentially absent after June. The cladoceran community in San Pablo Bay comprised only the “other” category, with the highest CPUE in December (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotifers\nAlthough rotifers are the most abundant type of zooplankton in the upper estuary, their abundance decreased dramatically since the start of the study (Figure 3). Interestingly, the decline in rotifer abundance began in the late 1970s, preceding the invasion by P. amurensis (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The rotifer community comprised species from the genera Polyarthra, Synchaeta, Keratella, and Trichocerca, as well as the “other” rotifer category, which includes the genus Asplanchna. Rotifer abundance increased in 2023 after several very low years but decreased again in 2024 when Synchaeta spp. abundance declined to about half that of 2023 (CPUE 5,864 and 11,502, respectively) (Figure 3). In 2024, “other” rotifers were most abundant, followed by Synchaeta spp. Synchaeta bicornis, Polyarthra spp. and Keratella spp. (Figure 3).\nKeratella and Polyarthra tended to be most abundant in freshwater and low-salinity regions (Figure 7), their preferred habitats (Winder and Jassby 2011). Increased abundances of these taxa in Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bay in the winter and spring of 2024 suggest fresher than usual conditions, though Synchaeta spp. co-occurred with them in all regions including San Pablo Bay. A spatial and temporal split was discernible between Synchaeta and the other rotifer groups, with Synchaeta spp. the dominant group in the North Delta, Confluence, Suisun Marsh, Suisun and Grizzly Bay, and San Pablo Bay during winter and spring months but largely absent after April except in San Pablo Bay. In Suisun and Grizzly Bay there was a noticeable increase in S. bicornis abundance from August through October, though Synchaeta spp. were also present. The “other” rotifers group was most abundant in the Central Delta during summer. In the South Delta, Polyarthra spp., and “other” were most abundant in spring and summer, with a dramatic increase in abundance of Synchaeta spp. in November 2024 (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMysids\nMysid abundances were higher overall during the first 12 years of the Zooplankton Study, with the highest abundance in 1986 (Figure 3). From 1987 to the present, annual abundances have varied from 2.1 to 29.4 (mean 12.3), with the 2024 annual CPUE of 16.6 slightly higher than 2023 (13.1) (Figure 3) and higher than the mean over this period. In addition to an overall decline since the inception of the study, the mysid community composition shifted dramatically. Prior to 1994, the native Neomysis mercedis was the most abundant species but since 1994 the mysid community has been dominated by the introduced Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 3). N. mercedis declined significantly during the 1976-1977 drought, likely related to food limitation from a lack of diatoms due to low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). N. mercedis populations rebounded after the drought and abundances remained high in the Suisun Bay region until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers declined dramatically and remained low (Orsi 1999). The mysid community in 2024 was dominated by H. longirostris, along with a small proportion of Neomysis kadiakensis. H. longirostris remained the most common mysid in the upper estuary, while the abundance of the once dominant native species N. mercedis remained extremely low, continuing the overall trend in mysid community composition since 1994.\nThe introduced mysid H. longirostris was first detected by the present study in 1993, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis. Although H. longirostris quickly became the most common mysid in the system, total mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam (Potamocorbula amurensis) invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 3). Historically mysids have been critically important in the diets of many fish species in the upper SFE, including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). The decline of mysids in the upper estuary led to a significant decrease in their presence in fish diets (Feyrer et al. 2003).\nIn 2024 H. longirostris, the dominant mysid species, was most common in the Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions from June through September, with an unusually high abundance in the South Delta in August (Figure 8). Neomysis kadiakensis, the second most abundant mysid species, followed a similar seasonal pattern to that of H. longirostris, although N. kadiakensis was also moderately abundant in San Pablo Bay in summer (Figure 8). Although abundances of the native N. mercedis remain very low, this species was found in the South Delta, Central Delta, Suisun Marsh, and San Pablo Bay in 2024.\nFrom January through April, mysids were essentially absent from all regions except Suisun and Grizzly Bay and San Pablo Bay. The mysid community in San Pablo Bay typically comprised the “other” species (Acanthomysis aspera, Acanthomysis hwanhaiensis, and Alienacanthomysis macropsis). This group was present during most months but most abundant in summer (June to August), along with smaller numbers of N. kadiakensis and H. longirostris (Figure 8). Note that the present study samples only the upper portion of San Pablo Bay, so these findings do not represent mysid community dynamics in other areas of San Pablo Bay."

    "text": "Zooplankton biomass\nBiomass (biomass per unit effort, BPUE, micrograms of carbon per cubic meter) was calculated for copepods, cladocerans, rotifers, and mysids (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4). Overall, rotifers (41%) and calanoid copepods (30%) comprise the majority of zooplankton biomass, followed by cyclopoid copepods (17%), cladocerans (11%), and mysids (1%) (Table 1). P. forbesi and Eurytemora were significant in all regions except San Pablo Bay, along with Acartiella in the Confluence and lower estuary (Suisun Marsh, Suisun and Grizzly Bay), and Tortanus in Suisun and Grizzly Bay and San Pablo Bay (Table 2). BPUE of cladocerans, largely Diaphanosoma, was high in the South and Central Delta regions (Tables 1, 2). The extremely abundant cyclopoid copepod Limnoithona sp., found in the tens of thousands in Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bay (Figure 5), only accounts for a maximum of 8% of total BPUE in these regions (Table 1). The cyclopoid O. davisae and the calanoids Acartia spp. and Tortanus spp. account for the highest percentage of carbon in San Pablo Bay (Tables 2, 3). Carbon from mysids only accounted for 1% of total carbon (Table 1), with higher BPUE in summer months in Suisun Marsh and Suisun and Grizzly Bay but generally low otherwise (Table 4)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn 2024, the Zooplankton Study recorded copepods, cladocerans, rotifers, and mysids at abundances consistent with historic downward trends in the upper estuary. Abundances of all zooplankton groups peaked in summer of 2024, and rotifer abundances were also high from February to April. Freshwater outflow in early 2024 was less intense and of shorter duration than in 2023, suggesting that low numbers of small zooplankton in upper estuary regions from January through March are likely related to seasonal patterns of productivity rather than outflow. The small, introduced cyclopoid Limnoithona tetraspina remained the most abundant copepod in upper estuary regions (North, South, and Central Delta), though its BPUE in these regions was low compared to calanoids, cladocerans, and rotifers. Mysid abundance remained low compared to historic levels but increased slightly in 2024 compared to 2023. The mysid community remained dominated by the introduced Hyperacanthomysis longirostris, in comparison to the pre-1987 community, which was dominated by the native Neomysis mercedis.\nThe long-term Zooplankton Study allows researchers and managers to track shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition in the upper estuary for more than five decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hyperacanthomysis longirostris, as well as the community’s response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing conservation strategies and food resources for fish in the upper San Francisco Estuary."

Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution."

    "section": "Why are phytoplankton important?",
    "text": "Why are phytoplankton important?\nPhytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish.\nPhytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action.\nChlorophyll-a is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton.\nSometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton."

    "text": "How is phytoplankton monitored?\nThe California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEP’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling. Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugol’s solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present.\nChanges in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers.\nBecause different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays."

Northern California experienced more atmospheric rivers than the previous year, but they were weaker storms. The majority of those atmospheric rivers made landfall January through March. Then near-record summer air temperatures dried out a lot of California toward the end of the water year.\nThe average specific conductance in water year 2024 was a little higher than the previous year. All regions had a notable drop after January due to the influx of freshwater. Most regions then had an increase during the summer months due to the high air temperatures. The Carquinez, San Pablo Bay, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay regions typically have higher values due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean.\nThe average turbidity in water year 2024 was a little lower than the previous year. Most regions had a spike in February due to sediment re-suspension caused by the high flows after storms. All regions downstream of the Confluence had another spike in May/June after a storm in that area. The Suisun Marsh had the highest values overall.\nThe average chlorophyll a in water year 2024 was a little lower than the previous year. The average and minimum values were similar in all regions. C10A in the South Delta had a large spike in July, due to aquatic vegetation that accumulated around the station. It is typically shallow during dry parts of the year.\nThe average dissolved ammonia, dissolved nitrate + nitrite, and total phosphorus in water year 2024 was similar to the previous year. All three nutrients had a slightly higher percentage of samples below the reporting limit than the previous year. Most regions had a spike in January due to increased runoff of organic matter and pollutants after storms. The South Delta region had some of the highest values of all three nutrients, due to nearby agricultural land use."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater Year 2024 started off dry, but a series of storms in February and March brought the water year to be classified as Above Normal. Patterns in water quality generally followed expected seasonal and regional trends. Specific conductivity varied greatly across the stations and throughout the water year, depending on precipitation and Delta outflow. North and South Delta stations remained fresh throughout the year, whereas most Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay stations had low specific conductivity values from February through early June. The specific conductivity at D6A, the westernmost station, started increasing in mid-March, far earlier than the rest of the stations. Decreases in dissolved oxygen and increases in turbidity were observed between February and March, likely associated with increased discharge from storm events. Shallow bays and Suisun Marsh exhibited more persistently high and variable turbidity compared with other stations. Elevated fluorescence, dissolved oxygen, and pH were measured in the South Delta during late June and July associated with a bloom event."

    "text": "Benthic monitoring conducted by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) since 1975 has documented changes in the composition, density, and distribution of the macrobenthic biota inhabiting the upper San Francisco Estuary. This monitoring is performed by the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) and is one component of the biological monitoring mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641. Since benthic species respond to changes in physical factors such as freshwater inflows, salinity, and substrate composition, benthic community data provides an indication of physical changes occurring within the Estuary. Benthic monitoring is an important component of the EMP because operation of the State Water Project can change the Estuary’s flow characteristics, affecting the density and distribution of benthic biota. Benthic monitoring data is also used to detect and document the presence of new, non-native species in the Upper Estuary, such as the 1986 arrival and subsequent wide spread of the overbite clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. This article summarizes benthic community characteristics at EMP monitoring sites in Water Year 2024 (October 1st 2023 through September 30th 2024) which was classified as above normal in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys (source). It contextualizes these observations using community data from the preceding decade."

    "text": "Overall Results\nThe benthic fauna collected in WY 2024 comprised nine phyla: Mollusca (47% of total organisms), Arthropoda (26%) and Mollusca (26%), with Phoronida, Nematoda, Chordata, Platyhelminthes, Cnidaria, and Nemertea together representing about 1% of total organisms. Of the 165 benthic species collected in WY 2024, the ten most abundant species represented 84% of all individuals collected throughout the year (Figure 2). These include four species of amphipod, two clams, three oligochate worms, and one polychate worm. Only four species in this group (the amphipods Americorophium spinicorne, Americorophium stimpsoni, and Hyalella sp., and the oligochaete worm Ilyodrilus franzti) are native to this estuary. The rest of the top ten species are non-native or are cosmopolitan species of unknown origin. Refer to Fields and Messer (1999) for descriptions of the habitat requirements, physical attributes, and feeding methods of many of these species.\nIn the site descriptions that follow, most species densities are reported as the annual densities of individuals/m2, sometimes noting dramatic seasonal peaks. Some species, especially arthropods, display strong seasonal variability with peak monthly densities several times higher than their annual densities. In these cases, we reported the time and magnitude of the peaks as well as the annual densities. Please note that station D41A was not sampled in October 2023 due to Coast Guard operations in the area, or in March 2024 due to boat mechanical problems. Due to missing these two months, comparisons to other years’ average annual densities or seasonal patterns should take this omission into account.

    "section": "Regional Results",
    "text": "Regional Results\n\nNorth Delta (D24)\nSite D24 is located on the Sacramento River, just south of the Rio Vista Bridge (Figure 1). There were 45 species in five phyla at D24 in WY 2024. Mollusca was the most abundant phylum for much of the year and made up 81% of all organisms collected at the station (Figure 3). Most of those mollusks (80% of all organisms) found at D24 in 2024 were the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea, with an annual average density of 2,359 individuals/m2. Corbicula fluminea density in 2024 was a rebound from the low levels of WY 2022- 2023, but not as high as the peak densities of WY 2018-2020, which peaked with 2018’s average of 3,484 individuals/m2. The second most abundant organism was the non-native amphipod Gammarus daiberi with a WY annual density of 254 individuals/m2, which was a similar decline from a WY 2021 peak of 870 individuals/m2. Besides these notable declines from 2020 or 2021 peaks, the composition of the community at D24 in 2024 was similar to other years in the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Delta (D16, D28A)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations, in the Central Delta, D16 and D28. Site D16 is on the lower San Joaquin River near Twitchell Island (Figure 1). There were 18 species in four phyla at D16 in WY 2024, split largely between Mollusca (75% of all organisms collected in 2024) and Arthropoda (24%) (Figure 4). The most abundant species at D16 was the clam Corbicula fluminea which accounted for 74% of all organisms in 2024, with an average annual density of 541 individuals/m2 and peaks in February and May-September 2024. The amphipod Gammarus daiberi was the second most abundant organism, accounting for 18% of all individuals, with an average annual density of 127 individuals/m2 and peaks in the warmer months, declining in October and November 2023, staying low through the winter and spring, and rising again in May through September 2024. Much of the rest of the community was a combination of various species of amphipods, insect larvae, and snails at lower densities. The total number of organisms at D16 in WY 2024 continued the trend of very low numbers compared with other years in the previous decade. In particular, WY 2020-2023 saw very low numbers of the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne, which was last seen in very high numbers at D16 from 2015-2018. One exception to this trend was Corbicula fluminea, which was at its highest level in the last decade, by at least twice the decadal average.\nThe site on Old River near Rancho Del Rio is known as D28A (Figure 1). In WY 2024, there were 61 species in six phyla at D28A. The most abundant phylum was Mollusca, followed by Annelida and Arthropoda (47%, 36%, and 17% of all organisms, respectively) (Figure 5). The most abundant species was the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea with an average density of 3,024 individuals/m2, followed by the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa with an average density of 1,708 individuals/m2 and higher densities between January and March 2024. While D28A had similarly high species richness in WY 2024 to other years, a few notable features of WY 2024 compared to the last decade were the markedly higher levels of the clam Corbicula fluminea, the snail Melanoides tuberculata, and the oligochaete worm Aulodrilus japonicus, along with a simultaneous strong decrease in the levels of the oligochaete worm Varichaetadrilus angustipenis to its lowest levels in a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Delta (P8, C9)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the South Delta. Site P8 is on the San Joaquin River at Buckley Cove (Figure 1). Station P8 had a total of 46 species in five phyla in WY 2024. Annelida was by far the most abundant phyla at this station, accounting for 79% of all organisms collected (Figure 6). The dominant species driving most of the Annelida patterns was the non-native sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which had an annual density of 833 individuals/m2 and accounted for 30% of all organisms. Despite it being the most numerous species at this station, Manayunkia speciosa in 2024 had decreased dramatically from the high densities seen from 2012 to 2016, which peaked at 11,705 individuals/m2 in WY 2016. The oligochate worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Varichaetadrilus angustipenis were the next most common organisms at 713 and 200 individuals/m2 annual density, along with Corbicula fluminea at 416 individuals/m2. These species were followed by a long tail of many species represented at low densities. This community composition is fairly consistent throughout the year and has remained largely unchanged through the last decade, except for lower total numbers of each phylum overall in WY 2024.\nSite C9 is on Old River at the Clifton Court Forebay intake (Figure 1). There were 74 species in six phyla at C9 in WY 2024, the most diverse site we sampled. Annelida was the dominant phylum throughout the year, accounting for 79% of all organisms collected in WY 2024, followed by 18% Arthropoda. (Figure 7). Two oligochaete worms, Ilyodrilus frantzi and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, made up 29% and 27% of all organisms respectively. Ilyodrilus frantzi had pronounced peaks in April and May, and an annual average of 2,946 individuals/m2, while Limnodrilus showed less seaonal variability in its annual average of 2,626 individuals/m2. Interestingly, these two worms seemed to have something of an inverse seasonal pattern with the oligochaete worm Varichaetadrilus angustipenis, which was the third most numerous species but whose average density of 1,596 individuals/m2 was much lower than its highs in 2013 and 2019-2021 at approximately twice of WY 2014 levels. Similar to P8, C9 has a large number of low-density species, including the highest diversity of aquatic insect larvae at any site sampled (17 species in WY 2023, mostly chironomid midges). The community was dominated by oligochaetes and has had similar overall composition for many years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfluence (D4)\nSite D4 is located near the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, just north of Point Sacramento (Figure 1). There were 35 species in five phyla at D4, of which Arthropoda was the most abundant (78% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (12% of all organisms) and Mollusca (9% of all organisms) (Figure 8). The native amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the most abundant species at this station and made up 61% of all individual organisms in WY 2023 with a seasonal peak near 15,000 individuals/m2 in May and June 2024 and an annual average of 6,016 individuals/m2, which was still below WY 2023’s annual average of 8,436 individuals/m2. The non-native amphipod Gammarus daiberi had an annual average of 1,336 individuals/m2, which had a marked seasonal peak in June of 4,894 individuals/m2. The invasive clam Corbicula fluminea had a steady year-round average (except for a low in January) of 1,128 individuals/m2, while the oligochaete worm Variachaetadrilus angustipenis had a dramatic peak in March of 2,635 individuals/m2 and low densities much of the rest of the year.\nBecause of D4’s position at the front of saltwater and freshwater mixing in the estuary, we often see a shift from the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea to more brackish-water Potamocorbula amurensis following dry years, and the reverse following wet years. The drought of 2018-2022 led to high Potamocorbula numbers, which abruptly crashed down in WY 2023 and 2024 while Corbicula increased strongly in both those years. WY 2024 was also notable for its continued rebound of amphipod Americorophium spinicorne in WY 2024 from the low of WY 2022, and the dramatic continued drop of oligochaetes Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Variachaetadrilus angustipenis from their decade highs in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuisun & Grizzly Bays (D6, D7)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the Suisun Bay area, D6 and D7. Site D6 is in Suisun Bay near the I-680 bridge (Figure 1) and had 26 species in three phyla in WY 2024. Mollusca was the dominant phylum, accounting for 97% of all organisms collected (Figure 9). Most of the organisms collected (96%) were the invasive Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which had an annual density of 12,768 individuals/m2, in an increase from its decade-long low in WY 2017 but still below its WY 2020 high of 23,800 individuals/m2. Potamocorbula amurensis was abundant from October 2023 through February 2024 but then decreased and stayed low through September 2024, likely as a result of seasonal recruitment in late summer 2023 followed by less favorable conditions in summer 2024. The relatively few other organisms found at this site were predominately from phylum Arthropoda, either the brackish-water bay barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus, found mostly growing on P. amurensis shells, or the cumacean arthopod Nippoleucon hinumensis.\nSite D7 is in Grizzly Bay, near the entrance to Suisun Slough (Figure 1). There were 23 species in four phyla in WY. Arthropoda comprised 54% of the total organisms, Mollusca 40%, and Annelida 6%. The non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis had an annual average 2,223 individuals/m2 and was most common in October-November 2023 and July- September 2024, following seasonal patterns of summer recruitment and die-off through winter. The amphipods Americorophium stimpsoni (962 individuals/m2, mostly in May and June 2024) and Sinocorophium alienense (869 individuals/m2, mostly in August and September 2024) were the next most numerous species. Nippoleucon hinumensis had an annual average density of 824 individuals/m2, mostly in November 2023-January 2024, rounding out the suite of numerically dominant arthropods whose seasonal peaks are spread through the year (Figure 10). While P. amurensis has been numerically dominant through the last decade, a major change in WY 2022 meant its annual densities since then are a fraction of what they were in 2013-2015. Sinocorophium alienense crashed in WY 2021, was completely absent from D7 in WY 2022, and although its modest recovery put it third most numerous at D7 in WY 2024 it does not compare to the large numbers from 2013-2020. The community in WY 2024 was both less diverse and had lower total numbers than much of the preceding decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Pablo Bay (D41, D41A)\nThe benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in San Pablo Bay, D41 and D41A. Station D41 is near Point Pinole (Figure 1) and has a benthic community primarily comprised of marine organisms, especially in drier water years. There were 57 species in eight phyla at D41 in WY 2024. Mollusca was the most abundant phylum (76% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (13%), Phoronida (9%), and Arthropoda (1%) (Figure 11). The single most abundant species was the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which alone accounted for 67% of all organisms and had an average annual density of 2,756 individuals/m2, almost all of which were seen from June-September 2024.  (Recall that summer 2024 recruitment at D6 seemed to be lower than in WY 2023; perhaps they were recruiting downstream at D41 instead.)  This increase resembles the high densities last seen in 2017-2019, and may be a similar pattern of downstream recruitment following wet water years. Phoronis harmeri, a native tube-dwelling filter-feeder from the small marine lophophorate phylum Phoronida, with an average annual density of 349 individuals/m2 and representing 9% of all organisms, was seen mostly from April-July 2024. April-July 2024 were also plentiful times for the non-native bag mussel Musculista senhousia (annual average 127 individuals/m2) and the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum (87 individuals/m2). D41 was the only site where we saw Cnidaria and Chordata in WY 2024, mostly in the form of small anemones and sea squirts (tunicates).  This pattern reinforces that higher-salinity water years such as 2021 see increases in more marine species such as Apelisca abdita, Phoronis harmeri, and Theora lubrica but lower numbers of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which prefers more brackish water and is mostly seen at D41 following wetter water years such as 2023 and 2024.  The resurgence of more marine-regime Musculista may be an early indicator that the wet years are drawing to a close, however.\nStation D41A is in San Pablo Bay near the mouth of the Petaluma River (Figure 1). There were 36 species in four phyla at D41A in WY 2024, a decade low for biodiverisity. The most abundant phyla was Mollusca (68% of all organisms), with Arthropoda second (17%) and Annelida third (15%) (Figure 12). The most numerous species was the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which had an annual average of 972 individuals/m2 and peaks in November 2023 and April-September 2024, probably benefitting from the same recruitment that did not occur at D6 in WY 2024, which is its centroid in drier years (see Hartman et al. 2024).  The next most numerous species were the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis (164 individuals/m2, mostly in April and May 2024), the polychaete worm Heteromastus filiformis (147 individuals/m2), the invasive mussel Musculista senhousia (119 individuals/m2, mostly in November 2023-February 2024) and the amphipod Ampelisca abdita (95 individuals/m2 , almost all in September 2024).  As opposed to their low levels in WY 2021-22, the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, Musculista senhousia, and Ampelisca abdita saw modest to strong increases in WY 2024, while Nippoleucon hinumensis, the Asian Semele clam Theora lubrica, the phoronid Phoronis harmeri, and the spionid polychaete worm Streblospio benedicti all saw sharp downturns in WY 2024 compared with earlier years of the preceding decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A."

    "text": "Interpretations\nIn summary, WY 2024 continues the trend of low average organism density begun in WY 2022. This trend was consistent across most sites, and was caused largely by the decrease in various amphipod species, especially Ampelisca abdita in San Pablo Bay and Sinocorophium alienense in Grizzly Bay, as well as the decrease in the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa at Central Delta sites. Since many fish species have switched to amphipod food sources after the collapse of mysid shrimps (Feyrer et al. 2003), the near disappearance of various amphipod species may have food web implications unless they have simply shifted their ranges out of our sampling area. The rallying in WY 2024 of Americoropium spinicorne and Americorophium stimpsoni found in fresher waters may be good for fish in those regions but might not replace their more brackish-water amphipod relatives. \nDensities of the non-native clams Potamocorbula amurensis and Corbicula fluminea started to rebound from their lows in the wet water years of WY 2022 and 2023, likely due to recruitment in their new downstream ranges that now matched their preferred salinity.  Corbicula fluminea saw a decade high density in WY 2024, possibly due high recruitment either immediately at D24 or from upstream sites outside the range of our sampling, which washed newly-settled Corbicula down with bedload sediment movement during those same wet winters.  Depending on what kind of water year comes in 2025, we may see continued increase of these two clams’ densities, or an abrupt water year change may affect their preferred salinity ranges and recruitment patterns. On the other hand, the new invasion of the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei near Stockton, first observed in October 2024, may start competing with Corbicula fluminea for phytoplankton and may negatively affect its population.\nOur ability to recognize these changes over decadal timescales highlights the importance of continued monitoring of benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient, as the community interacts with both various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web."

The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement."

    "text": "Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species.\nBenthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms.\nA large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary.\nChanges in benthic organisms’ populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition."

    "title": "Discrete Water Quality Background",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it.\nTypically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous)."

    "text": "Interpretations\nWater year 2024 was above average in precipitation for both the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their watersheds. Chlorophyll a and pheophytin a values were low overall, with many samples being below the detection limit. Higher outflows that can occur during wet or above normal water years often reduce the residence time of the water, leading to less opportunities for large algal blooms. The phytoplankton community in all regions was dominated by small, but numerically abundant, cyanobacteria. Phytoplankton fell into 12 distinct categories, similar to previous years, with nearly all groups being found in all regions. However, the top ten taxa fell into just 5 categories, showing that while the overall community is diverse, phytoplankton tend to be numerically dominated by a small number of algal groups."

    "text": "Zooplankton in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) serve as a vital link between aquatic primary producers and higher trophic level consumers. As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon through the large and complex SFE food web (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018; Hartman et al. 2025) that historically supported abundant fisheries. Zooplankton in the SFE are a key food source for endangered fish species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). Many species of fish, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traskii), Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper), Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma pentense), and American Shad (Alosa sapidissima)include zooplankton in their diets throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006, Feyrer et al. 2003). Changes in zooplankton abundance and community composition have been linked to major declines in pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011).\nThe importance of zooplankton in the estuarine food web prompted implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess prey resources available to fish in the upper SFE. The study is mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board’s Water Right Decision 1641 and conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For over five decades this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distribution patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting dramatic shifts in community composition."
