    "text": "Interpretations\nWater year 2024 was above average in precipitation for both the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their watersheds. Chlorophyll a and pheophytin a values were low overall, with many samples being below the detection limit. Higher outflows that can occur during wet or above normal water years often reduce the residence time of the water, leading to less opportunities for large algal blooms. The phytoplankton community in all regions was dominated by small, but numerically abundant, cyanobacteria. Phytoplankton fell into 12 distinct categories, similar to previous years, with nearly all groups being found in all regions. However, the top ten taxa fell into just 5 categories, showing that while the overall community is diverse, phytoplankton tend to be numerically dominated by a small number of algal groups."
