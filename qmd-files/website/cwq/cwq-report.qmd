## Introduction

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect continuous water chemistry data to monitor the water quality at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year `r report_year` (October 1st `r prev_year` through September 30th `r report_year`) `r str_water_year(report_year, 'cur')` [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST).

This report includes mandated stations collected by DWR's Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) and Suisun Marsh Water Quality Program (SMWQP) as well as USBR's Delta Water Quality Monitoring Program (USBR). Stations monitored by other programs were not included in this report. Additional information about these programs can be found [here](https://emp-dwr.github.io/emp-website/qmd-files/website/cwq/cwq-info.html).

## Methods

Water quality data was continuously monitored at 29 sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (@fig-stations; @tbl-stations). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays.

**Notes**:

-   The Sherman Island station (SSI), which was called D22A in previous reports, has been changed back to D11A.

-   The Cache Slough station (C19) is listed as a monitoring station for D-1641 but has not been in operation since 2015 due to lack of use and safety concerns.

cwq_stations <- readr::read_csv(here::here('admin/figures-tables/cwq/cwq_stations.csv'))

```

Data were collected for six water quality parameters and collection devices differed between stations (@tbl-programs). For CEMP and SMWQP, all water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. These parameters are:

-   Water Temperature (°C)
-   Specific Conductance (μS/cm 25°C)
-   Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)
-   pH
-   Turbidity (FNU)
-   Fluorescence (μg/L)

For Reclamation, water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using float-mounted YSI 6-series and EXO-1 multi-parameter water quality sondes as well as Hydrolab MS5 and HL4 water quality sondes. Parameters collected include:

-   Water Temperature (°C)
-   Specific Conductance (μS/cm 25°C)

cwq_programs <- readr::read_csv(here::here('admin/figures-tables/cwq/cwq_station-programs.csv'))

styler$style_kable(cwq_programs)
```

Regional facet graphs were created for each parameter. The average, minimum, and maximum values were determined for parameter, both overall and per region. Average summary statistics are reported as the mean (μ) ± the standard deviation.

#### Stockton Station DO Values

C-EMP monitors DO at the Stockton Ship channel to determine if/when it fall below limits established by the CVRWQCB (1998). For the months that coincide with the passage of fall-run Chinook salmon (October, November, and September), values `r obj_rri$disp_RRI_months('on months')`. For all other months, values `r obj_rri$disp_RRI_months('off months')`. A boxplot of the DO values is shown in @fig-rri.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rri
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

## Interpretations

Water Year 2024 started off dry, but a series of storms in February and March brought the water year to be classified as Above Normal. Patterns in water quality generally followed expected seasonal and regional trends. Specific conductivity varied greatly across the stations and throughout the water year, depending on precipitation and Delta outflow. North and South Delta stations remained fresh throughout the year, whereas most Confluence, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun and Grizzly Bay stations had low specific conductivity values from February through early June. The specific conductivity at D6A, the westernmost station, started increasing in mid-March, far earlier than the rest of the stations. Decreases in dissolved oxygen and increases in turbidity were observed between February and March, likely associated with increased discharge from storm events. Shallow bays and Suisun Marsh exhibited more persistently high and variable turbidity compared with other stations. Elevated fluorescence, dissolved oxygen, and pH were measured in the South Delta during late June and July associated with a bloom event.
