### Methods

Continuous data were collected for the water quality parameters shown in Table 1. Each of the `r site_number` monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface-specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll *a* fluorescence, and turbidity. Additionally, sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990's to monitor bottom SpC. Along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, these bottom SpC measurements determine compliance with the mandated salinity standard (also known as X2) set by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan. Except for bottom-specific conductance, all water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In contrast, bottom-specific conductance was measured at 1.5 meters above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data was recorded at 15-minute intervals.

### QA Status

Quality assurance and control measures were applied according to CEMP's Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) (Appendix A). Only data validated as "Good Data" according to Section 22 of the QAPP were analyzed for this report.

### Parameters

#### Water Temperature

Average daily water temperatures in the estuary ranged from `r range_txt('WaterTemperature', 'Surface')` (Figure 2), with fairly similar values across all regions. Temperatures were greater in the summer months and lowest in the winter.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path('admin/figures/cwq/graph_WaterTemperature.jpg'))
```

#### Specific Conductance

Average daily surface-specific conductance for the estuary ranged from `r range_txt('SpC', 'Surface')` (Figure 3). The lower values were observed at the Northern and Southern Interior Delta stations and the highest at the more tidally influenced Grizzly/Suisun Bay stations (Figure 3).

<!-- Bottom-specific conductance measured in `r report_year_txt` at D12A, D10A, and D6A stations exhibited seasonal patterns and ranges similar to the surface-specific conductance values. -->

```

#### Dissolved Oxygen

Average daily DO values in the estuary ranged from `r range_txt('DissolvedOxygen', 'Surface')` (Figure 4). Recorded daily averages did not fall below the standard set by the CVRWQCB in the Basin Plan (CVRWQCB, 1998). The monthly average DO levels at the Stockton station did not fall below the 5.0 mg/L standard set by the CVRWQCB (1998). In addition, the monthly average DO levels dropped below the 6.0 mg/L standard (SWRCB, 1995) for the passage of fall-run Chinook salmon through the ship channel in September and October for the September through November control period.
